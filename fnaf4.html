        <hr>
        
        <p>
        In Jule 24th 2015 Five nights at freddy's 4 was released. Originally the franchise was supposed to end with Five nights at freddy's 3 however, fans complained about the jumpscares and the fear factor of the game, so Scott, not wanting the franchise to end with a sour conclusion, made this game. Five nights at freddy's 4 is widly regarded as the scariest in the franchise and for good reason. The atmosphere that this game creates is unmatched by most of the games. In this game you don't play as a security guard, instead you play as a kid trapped in it's room and defending themselves from nightmarish versions of our beloved animatronics. These nightmares are:

        The room consists of two bedroom doors that lead to the left and right hallway, a closet and a bed. You have to check every single one of these spots if you want to survive. Another issue is that the room is plunged in darkness, your only light is a flashlight and its your only "weapon" against the nightmares however, you need to be careful when you flash your light in the hallways, because your either gonna scare them away or get a loud jumpscare which will lead to your death. Which is why its so important to listen for their breathing before opening the flashlight. You see, the game immediately makes it clear that it's important to listen to the breathing and, if you do, close the door. But, the doors aren't they only thing that should worry the player. Nightmare Freddy is behind the player on the bed, while on the closet Foxy lurks. There's more to this that will be expanded upon in the AI section. But, even if you make it through the night, it's not over yet, there's a plushtrap mini game, that if you beat you get to skip two hours of the next night (Note: This skip will dissapear if you lose or quit the game). So, with the question taking a more terrifying tone, can you survive?
        </p>
        
        <h2>AI</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Suprisingly, five nights at freddy's 4 still uses the movement opportunity system to a certain extent. However, It has a lot of diffrences compared to the three games that came before it making it quite a challenging game because of its vastly improved AI.To explain how this AI behaves a map of the house five nights at freddy's 4 is taking place in is needed</p>
        
        <img src="photos/https://i.redd.it/bd3jx6tjv4z01.png" height="300" width="300" class="fnaf4Map">
        
        <p>As you can see it's seeperated into six parts, the left and right hallway, the bedroom, the closet, the kitchen and the center part, which is where the animatronics start at. Now that we have a good sense of the map explaining the AI will be much easier. Like the five nights at freddy's 3 explanation, the AI behaviour will be explained first and then how much they change during the nights.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Nightmare Bonnie and Chica:
            <p>These two will be explained together since they have similar patterns. They both start out at the center and they have a movement opportunity every 5 seconds. This opportunity can be prevented by the player listening to the door they are planned to attack at, if you have successfully prevented an attack from one of them but keep the door closed or if the player closes the door when they're in the hall but not by the door. From the center they will move to their sides of the center, bonnie to the left and chica to the right. From there bonnie can enter the left hallway or move back to the center(50% chance) and chica will either go the right hallway or the kitchen(50% chance again). On their next movement from the hall they'll move to the door. It's important to check the door otherwise if they wait for about 20 seconds they're gonna jumpscare the player the next time he leaves a door or checks the bed. Dealing with them involves flashing the light at them when the're in the hall or closing the door if you here breathing right outside the door. If the player flashes the light when they're in the door it will result in a jumpscare but, if they close the door when they're at the hall, the animatronics will instantly move to the door forcing the player to shut the door again or risk dying. That's all about bonnie and chica </p></li><br>
            <li>Nightmare Foxy:
            <p>Foxy is, once again, intresting. He also starts at the center with a movement opportunity every 5 seconds. Where he deffers is that he doesn't have a side and can move either to the right or left side of the center. From there he has a 10% chance to enter the hallway from the side his in and a 90% chance to switch to the other side of the center. When he's in this stage you can avoid him shining your light at the correct hallway. If that fails and the player checks the wrong door he will enter the closet( When he enters for the first time he will be at the final stage of his attack mode so the player must focus on him). In this stage he enters attack mode and has 4 stages. In the first stage he's a plushie, in the second his hook and leg are visible, in the third he's crouching' and in the fourth he is peeking out of the closet. The way foxy advances through stages is through successful movement opportunities and if he achieves 5 consecutive movement opportunities the player will be jumpscared. This can be prevented by shutting the closet door and holding it. For every second the closet is closed he's stage is decreased by 1 so, if he's in his final stage, the player will have to shut the door for 4 seconds. And that's it for foxy. </p></li><br>
            <li>Nightmare Freddy:
            <p>Nightmare freddy is weird in this game. He doesn't really have movement patterns. Instead he kind of acts like a timer. He has a bar that goes up to 80 and every 4 seconds he'll add his AI level to the bar increasing faster every night. The way the player understands where freddy is ont the progress bar is through the freddles.</p>
                
                <img src="photos/https://preview.redd.it/if-fnaf-4-isnt-a-dream-then-how-do-we-explain-these-little-v0-iorokc25680b1.jpg?auto=webp&s=dab05bda440040a30c0d189b6f2641571e393131" height="300" width="300" class="fnaf4Map">
                
            <p>These are basically miny versions of freddy that spawn every time the bar has reached 10, 20 and 30 adding up to 3 freddles. If the player shines his light long enough the freddles will go away and freddy will be reset however, if the bar reaches over 60 the player will get jumscared the next time he checks the bed. That concludes Freddy and his weird AI.</p></li><br>
            <li>Nightmare Fredbear and Nightmare:
            <p>Okay, these two are intresting. Nightmare Fredbear only shows up in night 5( For the full night) and night 6 after 4 AM and Nightmare in night 7(nightmare mode) and night 8(4/20 mode(Yes there is an 8th night in this game) after 4 AM. They are pretty similar only Nightmare is a bit faster than fredbear. They both start out at the center and fredbear has a movement opportunity every 3 seconds, while nightmare every 2 seconds. They'll later move on to either side of the center and proceed to either enter the hall or enter the other side of the center. From the hall, if not checked, the player will be jumpscared after 15 seconds on nights 5 and 6, and 10 seconds on night 7 and 8 seconds on night 8. If they're in the hallway flashing the light will reveal them and keeping it on without closing the door will result in a game over. Closing the door will lead them to the other side of the center. However they can enter the closet and bed if they've been waiting on the hall for 10 seconds and the player checks the other hall. Occasionally they can also teleport immediatelly teleport to the room randomly which will be clear by their laughter( Carefull! They can also fake laugh which can confuse the player). From the bed or closet it takes fredbear 15 seconds to kill the player while nightmare takes only 11. Definetely the two most intresting and hardest characters to deal with in this game</p></li><br>
            <li>Plushtrap:
            <p>Plushtrap isn't an animatronic that is a threat during the main nights. Instead there's a minigame releted to it that takes place in a diffrent are of the house and, if won, will allow the player to skip 2 hours of the next night.<!--plushtrap minigame map--> </p>
            <p>This is the area the minigame takes place in consisting of four rooms, a hallway and a chair at the end of that hallway where plaushtrap is slumped over. There's also an x infront of the player and the goal is to lure plaushtrap into the x without dying or running out of time. Plushtrap will start at 0 aggression which will increase every frame the light isn't on along with a bonus of 1 or 2 every time he moves. Every 2 seconds plushtrap will move if its aggressiveness is high enough( Between 400 and 499). Moving resets his aggresion to 200 while flashing the light resets him entirely. Plaustrap has 4 stages getting of the chair, moving to the left or right rooms closer to the chair, he then moves to the middle of the hall and then to either the right or left room closer to the player and finally he'll either be stopped at the x or jumpscare the player. That's the final animatronic!</p></li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that we're done wit the animatronics, let's check how their night AI changes</p>

            Nightmare AI: 20<br></li><br>
            
        </ul>
        
        <p>It's also important to mention that there's challenges int the game that the player can complete, these are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blind mode: Blackens the screen forcing the player to only use sound</li><br>
            <li>Insta-Foxy: Spawns foxy in the closet</li><br>
            <li>Mad Freddy: Makes Freddy faster</li><br>
            <li>All Nightmare: Player goes against 4/20 nightmare for the whole night</li><br>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And that's five nights at freddy's 4! This game isn't only the scariest but the most intresting when it comes to AI yet making it one of the best in the series.</p>
