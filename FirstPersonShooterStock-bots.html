    <h2>Stock AI Bots</h2>
    <p>Stock AI bots in Team Fortress 2 offer a challenging gaming experience. Learn about their behaviors, difficulty levels, and how to adapt your strategy to outsmart them.</p>

    <p>The stock AI bots, or TFBots, are designed to emulate human players and are not directly controlled. Additionally, their classes are chosen at random. They use sophisticated AI code based on the PlayerBot and Infected AI featured in the Left 4 Dead series.[1] AI bots do not require the server to have cheats enabled; therefore, achievements are enabled while playing with them. There is one exception, however; Bots do not see Deathcam shots when killed; therefore, a player cannot attain Deathcam-related achievements. Also, killing a bot with a Strange weapon will not increase the weapon's kill count, unless the weapon has a Strange Part: Robots Destroyed applied to it, in which case, the kill will be added to the Strange Part and not the main counter.</p>

    <p>AI bots come in four skill levels ranging from easy to expert. Sigsegv has compiled a detailed explanation of the skill differences.</p>

    <p>AI bots can be indirectly controlled to an extent:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Any friendly and enemy bot that the player focuses on with their crosshair during setup time will taunt.</li>
        <li>A friendly Medic bot will heal a player if they utilize the "Medic!" voice command.</li>
        <li>If a Medic bot is healing and has an ÜberCharge ready, using the voice commands "Go go go!" or "Activate Charge!" will cause the bot to immediately activate his ÜberCharge.</li>
        <li>A Medic bot with an ÜberCharge ready will immediately activate the charge if he or the healing target gets hurt significantly.</li>
        <li>Bots will attempt to join teammates performing a partner taunt (e.g. the High Five) or a group taunt (e.g. the Conga).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Using bots on unsupported maps:</p>

    <p>Nav mesh editing requires cheats enabled, so type "sv_cheats 1" in the console.</p>
    <p>Build the initial nav mesh using the "nav_generate" command.</p>
    <p>Wait while the game generates AI paths, progress is tracked in the console.</p>
    <p>Map will reload.</p>
    <p>Optionally tweak the generated nav mesh to add missing data and remove erroneous data. Use "nav_edit 1" to enter nav mesh editing mode.</p>
    <p>Reload/Restart the server (optional, but if it is not done, then achievements will be disabled).</p>
    <p>Open console and type "tf_bot_add <number>" as above to add bots.</p>
    <p>WARNING: The game is likely to crash if you edit the navigation mesh with bots enabled.</p>

    <p>Bots can be used on any map on which the above steps have been performed without having to repeat them, except for entering the "tf_bot_add <number>" command each time bots need to be added.</p>

    <p>Auto-generated nav meshes work best on Control Points, King of the Hill, Payload, and Capture the Flag maps. On Mannpower maps, the bots will play as Capture the Flag, but be unable to use Grappling Hooks or intelligently use the Powerups they walk over.</p>

    <p>Setting the value of the console command "tf_bot_offense_must_push_time" to 0 allows bots to fight each other in maps without objectives that they can recognize, unless the map doesn't have any respawn room entities.</p>
