        Horror games are extremely popular amongst the gaming genre transforming the horror genre in a way horror movies could never achieve.
            By leting the player take control of the main character, horror games have undoubtly brought a sense of dread and fear that the viewer simply couldn't experience through a horror flick, mostly because of the control the player has over the main protagonists' actions and decisions, something, obviously, that is lacking when it comes to horror movies. When the player has control over the main character every horrifying moment, every stressful situation and every terrifying death is up to the player's actions and the way they handle the situation. Horror games will use a lot of diffrent techniques to scare the player like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jumpscares</li>
                <li>Unsetling soundtrack</li>
                <li>Dark or gruesome environments</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            And while these are ffective ways creep the player out the game would not be nearly as affective without a convincing antagonist/s. And that's where Artificial Intelligence and machine learning come into play.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Horror game AI</h2>
        <p>
            Without Artificial Intellige the enemies of the horror game wouldn't be nearly as effective. It is important for the enemy ai to be able to predict the players movement and actions so it can provide a challenge by opposing the player. There is several ways that horror games interpret ai, it can either be scripted appearing only in certain sections of the game and performing certain actions that will be suprising to the player at first however, in a second playthrough these actions will be predictable and will not suprise the player anymore, or it can be a stalker type enemy that constantly follows the player during the game. While hard to code, it ultimately makes for a far more memorable antagonist and for more intriguing encounters. However there is a popular game with a very peculiar code that will be focused on in this page. That game is the popular mascot horror game Five nights at freddy's.
