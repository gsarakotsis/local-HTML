        <h3>AI in FIFA Games throughout the years</h3>
        <p>The early editions of the FIFA series primarily focused on basic gameplay mechanics and graphics. AI opponents were relatively simple, with limited strategic decision-making.As technology advanced in the 2000s, so did the sophistication of AI in FIFA games. Developers implemented more realistic player movements, improved tactical AI for both offensive and defensive play, as well as introduced features like dynamic difficulty adjustment to make matches more competitive and engaging. In 2010 FIFA incorporated AI-driven features for player personalization. This included improved player behavior and responsiveness, creating a more immersive gaming experience. Also since FIFA transitioned to the Frostbite game engine in FIFA 17,  EA started introducing enhanced graphics and more realistic player animations.</p>

            <li>Realism in player behavior:

                <ul>
                    <li><h5>Movement and positioning:</h5><p>
                       FIFA's AI opponents are designed to move and position themselves on the field realistically. This involves understanding the flοw of the game, making strategic runs, and maintaining defensive shapes similar to real soccer teams. For example in strategic runs the AI intelligently executes strategic runs, exploiting spaces and making well-timed dashes to receive passes or create gοal-scoring οpportunities.

                    <li><h5>Decision-making:</h5><p>
                        The AI in FIFA analyzes various factors such as player statistics, match context, and the current score to make informed decisions. This includes passing, shooting, and defensive actions.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Adaptability
                <ul>
                    <li><h5>Dynamic strategies:</h5><p> FIFA's AI adapts its strategies based on the player's actions. If the player consistently exploits a certain tactic, the AI may adjust its defensive approach or change its offensive strategies to counteract the player's style.</p></li>
                    <li><h5>Difficulty levels:</h5><p>
                    The game often offers different difficulty levels, and the AI adjusts its skill level accordingly. This ensures that players of all skill levels can find a suitable challenge.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Player styles:

                <ul>
                    <li><h5>Individual player behaviors:</h5> <p>AI-controlled players in FIFA exhibit styles inspired by real-life soccer players. For example, a star striker might tend to take long shots, while a defensive midfielder may focus on interceptions and accurate passing.</p>

            <li>Learning algorithms
                <ul>
                    <li><h5>Machine learning elements:</h5><p>
                    FIFA games may incorporate machine learning elements to allow the AI to learn and adapt over time. This could mean that the AI observes player behavior in certain situations and adjusts its responses accordingly in future matches.</p>
