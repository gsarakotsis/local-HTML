    <h3>AI Bot Behavior</h3>
    <p>Bots currently cannot execute special jumps (such as rocket jumps) or haul buildings.</p>
    <p>If a bot kills a player, they roll a chance to taunt immediately after, and if it succeeds, they will taunt even if they are under enemy fire. However, bots will not taunt if carrying the enemy intelligence. This behavior applies to Robots in Mann vs. Machine mode.</p>
    <p>Spy bots (and players) are properly ignored by other bots while disguised. However, upon 'touching' any enemy bot, sapping, shooting, or Cloaking, all other bots who see it happen will declare the bot/player a Spy and won't forget who they are until they change disguises while unseen or until the bot(s) who declared them a Spy dies or feigns death with the Dead Ringer.</p>
    <p>Pyro bots will use the compression blast against projectiles and opponents with unusual frequency if on difficulties other than Easy.</p>
    <p>Medic bots will usually heal all other classes before Snipers (and to a lesser extent Engineers) even if the "Medic!" voice command is used.</p>
    <p>Medic bots tend to favor Heavies, Soldiers, Demomen, and Pyros, if being played by a human. If no human player is one of these classes, they are not likely to be pocketed.</p>
    <p>A Medic bot with an ÜberCharge ready will immediately activate the charge if he gets hurt. This behavior is used by Über Medics in Mann vs. Machine mode.</p>
    <p>Bots do not attack during setup time unless they are attacked first (with the exception of Demoman bots planting stickybombs).</p>
    <p>Engineer bots do not upgrade (or even remove Sappers from) their Teleporters, and sometimes don't repair their Sentry Guns even when they're not under fire.</p>
    <p>Engineer bots will never repair or upgrade a friendly Engineer bot's building unless that building is in the way of the Engineer's target.</p>
    <p>Bots, excluding Engineers, Snipers, and Spies, will stay in their spawn positions on setup when attacking in an Attack/Defend map or a Payload map.</p>
    <p>Spy bots, when spotted by another bot (possibly a player), will not attempt to backstab and will instead switch to their Revolver and shoot while retreating.</p>
    <p>Demoman bots, once they know where a Sentry Gun is (usually after dying to one), will be able to stand out of range of the sentry and perfectly aim and time their stickybomb charges to land precisely where the Sentry Gun is. Walls and ceilings may occasionally get in the way of the stickybombs' flight path, though.</p>
    <p>Sniper bots, upon scoping in and not finding a target, will use one of the "Negative" voice commands.</p>
    <p>Friendly Medics will tend to heal a disguised Spy.</p>
