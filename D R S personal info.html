    <p>
     Greetings reader, 

        I am Diogenis R. Skenderoglou, Project Lead for the AI Analysts team. As Team Leader, I have been in charge of project development when it comes to creating this here website. I've also assumed many logistical, comunication and general development responsibilities. During the development process of our website, I organized team meetings, ensured everyone was present and on time for group development sessions, established miniature deadlines to separate the workload and ensure everyone stayed on track with the HTML and CSS coding of their pages. In terms of communication, I strove to ensure not only an open discussion between the members of our development team, but also with the Project Overseer and upper management. Additionally, I kept a clear record of our development studio's proceedings and progress throughout the creation of the website, making sure that the Project Overseer was regularly informed of the website's status. In terms of code, I am directly responsible for the "Home" and "About Us" pages, as well as the CSS for every non genre-specific page of the website. Along with this, I also coded the vast majority of Javascript present on the website and oversaw the work of other developers to prevent bugs and ensure everything was functioning as intended. Lastly, I was also responsible for maintaining team cohesion, proper work ethic, and abiding by the development standards set by the Project Overseer.
        
    My personal contact information is available in the "About Us" page of the website. In case of any errors, bugs, or other problems with your experience regarding our website, feel free to contant me or any of the development team members. 
    </p>
