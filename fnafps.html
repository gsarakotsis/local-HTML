        <h2>A brief descripton</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator was released in December 4th 2017, originally posing as an innocent 8-bit pizzeria tycoon game giving player's quite a suprise when they realised it is actually Five nights at feddy's 6. You are now a manager of your own pizzeria making financial decisions and trying to run your restaurant until Saturday when a big party is happening. The game is seperated in three phases. In the tycoon phase, you build your own pizzeria and play minigames. Then there's the office section, playing more like a classic Five nights at freddy's, you're stuck in a small office with two open vents on your right and left and a monitor infront of you which you use to complete tasks in order to end the night. You're armed with a flashlight but, it's basically useless since it won't le you see inside the vents and its more of a tool to possibly prevent the animatronics from getting you. In addition, the office can get quite warm, and in order to prevent passing out, the player has to keep the ventilation going, but the ventilation is really loud attracting the animatronics to your position. It is important in this game that you make barely any noise to not be in danger, which is almost impossible considering that tasks and ads that you accepted in the tycoon phase make a lot of noise. There are ways to defend yourself. The monitor is equipped with a scanner to track the animatronics' position, an audio system to attract animatronics to another position and a silent ventilation for obvious reasons. However, you can only keep one active and it's not a gurantee that they will work, so, when one of the animatronics approaches, your only hope is to shut off the ventilation and monitor and flash your light at the vent the noise is coming from. The animatronics that you will face are:

            The way they get in the restaurant is through the third phase called salvage phase. This phase happens day by day. You're in a dimly lit room with a hostile animatrone on the other end of the table and you can choose to either throw it back into the alley where you found it or choose to salvage it for more money. If you choose to salvage it you need to complete a maintanance checklist whilst keeping an eye on the animatronic for any movement. If there is any movement it's best to shock the animatronic to prevent it from attacking but, you can only use the taser three times before it decreases the value of the animatronic. If the animatronic jumpscares you it will enter the pizzeria and you won't get payed. So, for one final time, can you survive?
        </p>
        
        <h2>AI</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>There's not a lot of information about pizzeria sim's animatronic AI, however the general theory is that they still use the, now well known, movement opportunity system. Before we get into the analysis it is important to clear up somethimg. The tycoon phase will not be focused on since it doesn't depend much on animatronic AI, instead, the main focus will be the office and salvage phases and it's fitting that we start with the offfice.</p>
        
        <h2>Office phase</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <img src="photos/https://d1fs8ljxwyzba6.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2017/12/05/how-to-unlock-hidden-lore-in-mini-games-of-freddy-fazbears-pizzeria-simulator_feature.jpg" height="300" width="500" class="fnaf6Map">
        
        <p>The office section is where the animatronics use the movement opportunity system which has been more 
            thoroughly explained in the Five nights at freddy's page. The office map looks like this:</p>
        
        <img src="photos/https://m.gjcdn.net/fireside-post-image/900/1814085-gbmrqeiy-v4.webp" height="300" width="500" class="fnaf6Map">
        
        <p> and the animatronics will spawn at a random location on the top of it. Every animatronic has a 1/3 chance they'll move during each movement opportunity. The time that it takes for them to initiate a movement opportunity decreases with each day:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Monday => 8 seconds</li>
        <li>Tuesday => 5 seconds</li>
        <li>Wednesday => 4 seconds</li>
        <li>Thursday => 3 seconds</li>
        <li>Friday => 2.5 seconds</li>
        <li>Saturday => 2 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There's also a new special mechanic called monotony and it becomes active from Wednesday. This occurs every time the player hasn't looked at the vents for 30 seconds and that will lead to the animatronics having movement opportunities every 2 seconds regardless of the day. Even worse, if it has been 45 seconds they'll get a movement opportunity every 1 second. Turning will reset the timer. When it comes to where they move is when things get complecated. It's not confirmed, but the running theory is that they move similarly to springtrap, meaning the can move backwords but, most of the time, they'll just move towards the player. Lasly, and this one is quite important, they can teleport. Yeah, Molten freddy,when he is in the top middle room can teleport instantly to the players closest vent on the left while scraptrap and scrapbaby, 20 seconds into the night, will theleport to the right side. Thankfully this only happens once a night and, suprisingly, lefty doesn't do this. That's about it for the office section moving on to the salvage phase.</p>

        <img src="photos/https://pm1.narvii.com/6769/13668b32d414f2cde9300d60f18877cb6a0f28f6v2_00.jpg" height="300" width="500" class="fnaf6Map">
        
        <p>In the salvage phase the animatronics work on an aggresion bar. When the salvage starts, the animatronic is randomly at 0 or 100 aggression. There's five tapes that need to be played and for every 10 seconds that a tape is played there's a 50% chance that aggresion will increase by 150 + 50 * day number. For every second the player looks at the page, the aggresion will increase by 10 + 10 * day number. There's also a 50% chance that on the fourth tape aggresion will spike to 750. The animatronic will attack once 1200 aggression has been reached or when it's at 1000 aggression and the player looks at the paper. The animatronics aggression can be tracked visually through how they sit. They have three different stages and on the third stage it's best to use the tazer to avoid a jumpscare.</p>
        
        <p>That's it for five night's at freddy's 6. It's the smallest page mostly because of the lack of information. However this doesn't make it less intresting than the rest of the games. With that said this analysis has come to an end. There are more games and surely more to come however, it's best that it ends here as  the site shouldn't be filled with pages of five nights at freddy's AI.</p>
