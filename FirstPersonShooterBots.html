        <p>“Human teammates might judge you, but will these soulless automatons? YES. They're not blind. But they ARE mute, so your incompetence is a secret they will take to their grave.”<br>

    <p>A bot is a computer-controlled player on a server. There are two types of bots in Team Fortress 2: AI bots and Puppet bots. AI bots are coded with sophisticated artificial intelligence designed to emulate player actions in the game and can be used without enabling cheats. Puppet bots have no AI coding but are useful for testing and training. Puppet bots require the server to have cheats enabled, which also disables achievements.</p>
