    <h3>AI Analysts Website Developer</h3>
    <p>
        I am Athanasios Tsoukalas, developer of the horror game section of this website. I have also assisted in the complition of the javascript of the home page along with the leader and another fellow developer.<br> I am responsible for the Five nights at freddy's .html files, the .css of these files along with the Horror description. And, I completed part of the slideshow present on the main page, however most of the code was done by the leader, I just put in the final details.<br> During development, there weren't many issues. The communication between members was decent and there was enough info for me to complete this section. I mainly focused on how the AI operates and how it behaves.<br> My contact information is available in the About Us page of the website.
