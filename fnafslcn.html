         <h2>A brief descripton</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
        Five nights at freddy's: Sister location was released in October 7th 2016 being the first Five nights at freddy's to completely change the formula. This game plays out more like a standard singleplayer campaign with scripted encounters that make the game five nights long with two quite intresting endings. As It's, probably, clear, this game focuses more on the story than the AI so, we can't really talk about it. However, due to fan outcry for a classic five nights at freddy's experience, Scott created a custom night that plays kind of like the original Five nights at freddy's with the power managment and doors that need closing for the player to survive with the addition of a vent that the player can close. That is where th similarities with the original stop, because this custom night has a lot more animatronics and a lot more mechanics which will be introduced in the AI section. For now, let's introduce the animatronics the player will face:

            All this provides quite a challenge and the more challenges the player beats the more facts about the story are revealed making it a worthy challenge for everyone who wanted a more classic Five nights at freddy's playstyle.

        <h2>AI</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>As mentioned, the original sister location works more like a campaign rather than a classic five night's at freddy's, however, that's not entirely true. If the player beats the game normally, completes all 8-bit minigames and, after fixing baby in night 5, instead of following baby's instructions, the player holds shift + W + D and flicks their mouse to the right, they will enter a sort of bossfight with Ennard an amalgamation of the sister location animatronics.</p>
        
        <img src="photos/https://pm1.aminoapps.com/6716/ba13d4792ee7ff67bc1fd8c236a88885bb536218_hq.jpg" height="300" width="300" class="ennard">
        
        <p> This fight takes place in the custom night location</p>
        
        <img src="photos/https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/c0/68/3cc068c2b3fa05d930fe1b2720c6dacc.jpg" height="300" width="300" class="ennard">
        
        <p>This means that it takes a more classic approach with power managment and doors that need closing. Ennard also works similarly to the original animatronics using the movement opportunity system we've become so familiar with. However, what sets Ennard apart is that he has a 50% chance to move no matter the time or place and his interval, instead of being set like the 5 seconds Bonnie takes for a movement opportunity in the original, decreases throught the night:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>12 AM - 1 AM => interval=10 seconds<br>
            1 AM - 3 AM => interval=6 seconds<br>
            4 AM => interval=3 seconds<br>
            5 AM => interval=2 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to mention this since, apart from the custom night, this is the only time in the main game where there is AI that isn't completely scripted.</p>
        
        <p>Sister location custom night doesn't actually have nights. It's a lot of challenges with a difficulty selector from easy to very hard, with Golden Freddy on very hard being the classic 10/20 mode. So, before we go into the challenges and how they change the AI value, let's explain the animatronics and their behaviour.</p>
        <ul>
        [1]<li>Ballora:<br>
            <p>Ballora indicates her position through 4 different stages of her music. These are silent, distant, moderate and loud. On loud the player should close the door or ballora will jumpscare them. Ballora has a counter that is set to 50 and once it reaches her AI value she will move and the counter will reset. The counter drops by 1 every 0.2 seconds however, like Ennard, ballora will become more aggresive at 4 and 5 AM increasing her AI level by 5.</p></li><br>
        <li>Funtime Freddy:<br>
            <p>Funtime Freddy can spawn in either cam 3 or cam 4 when the night begins. Like ballora, he has a counter that starts at 30 and decreases by 1 every second. Once the counter has reached his AI value he will move to the opposite camera which resets the counter. When he enters attack mode every 3 seconds a random number is generated from 0-39. If that number is lower than Freddy's AI value an he hasn't moved for 4.6 seconds he will sent his hand puppet Bon-bon after the player. Bon-bon has a 2/3 chance to attack from the same side Freddy's in or a 1/3 chance to attack from the opposite side. Funtime freddy has two different voice lines that will help the player determine which door they should close.</p></li><br>
        <li>Funtime Foxy:<br>
            <p>Funtime Foxy also has a counter that is set to a number between 40 and 50. The counter decreases by 1 every 0.25 seconds and when the counter reaches his AI level he will reach the next phase and the counter will reset to another random value. Looking at cam 7 will reset the counter to the original value preventing foxy from attacking. He has five phases which are behind the curtain, peeking out, leaving the cove, looking at the camera and gone. When he has reached gone he will attempt to get in the office after 5 seconds. This can be prevented by shutting the right door but, that will drain 1% power</p></li><br>
        <li>Bidybab:<br>
            <p>Bidybab will spawn in the vent and has an AI value/50 chance to move every 3 seconds. The progress can be tracked through certain voice lines and once she's on stage 3, shut the vent door and she will be reset. Like ballora her AI will increase by 5 at 4 AM and by 10 at 5 AM.</p></li><br>
        <li>Electrobab:<br>
            <p>Electrobab will spawn in the opposite camera of the one funtime freddy is in and it has a counter set to 30 that drains by 1 every second. When the counter reaches its AI level that's when it will spawn and will drain 1% power every 5 seconds. This can be prevented via a controlled shock which will reset it. </p></li><br>
        <li>Minireena 1:<br>
            <p>Minireena 1 uses the exact same counter of 30 as the electrobab. Once it reaches its AI level it will drain the oxygen faster and faster depending on these values:
            0.5 seconds => 1, 0.25 seconds => 2, 0.10 seconds => 3, 0.07 seconds => 4 and 0.05 seconds => 5.</p>
            <p>A controlled shock will stop this
            </p></li><br>
        <li>Minireena 2:<br>
            <p>Minireena 2 has an AI value/30 chance to spawn a minireena to block your view every time the camera drops. They will stop spawning once 5 of them have gathered on the player's screen</p></li><br>
        <li>Yenndo:<br>
            <p>He has an (AI value - 1)/25 chance to appear on a camera drop. Once he's in the office he drains oxygen extremely fast(rate of 1% every 0.02 seconds). He jumpscares the player after approximately 1 second.</p></li><br>
        <li>Bonnet:<br>
            <p>Bonnet has an AI value/30 chance to spawn on camera drop. She'll move across the office from right to left and the player has to click her nose to prevent a game over.</p></li><br>
        <li>Lolbit:<br>
            <p>She has an AI value/50 to spawn every 3 seconds. She will first appear in the office minitors and then flash a please stand by creen preventing the player from checking the cameras and closing the doors. To stop this the player has to type LOL on the keyboard.</p></li><br>
            
        </ul>
        <p>Now that we're done explaining the animatronics, let's move over to the challenges and how they change the AI. Note! this'll only focus on the very hard mode of the challenges.</p>
