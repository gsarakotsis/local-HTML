    <p>
     Salutations reader, 

     I am George D. Sarakotsis, One of the Website Developers for the AI Analysts team. My position puts me in charge of most of the CSS files on this project. I’m also Assistant Developer for the Java file with the help of the Leader, generally though I am the Lead developer of the First Person Shooter. During the development process of our website, I helped point out rouge mistakes on the code and fixed them with the team’s help before they managed to become massive problems for the HTML and CSS coding of the pages. In terms of communication, there were no problems. In terms of code, I am directly responsible for the FirstPersonShooter.html, JavaHome.java, CSS_Stylesheet.css, Website_Home_Page.html and Styles.css files of the website. Along with this, I also assisted in Javascript present on the website and helped the other developers to prevent bugs and ensure everything was functioning as intended. My personal contact information is available in the "About Us" page of the website. In case of any errors, bugs, or other problems with your experience regarding our website, please try to contant any of the development team members for help.
    </p>
