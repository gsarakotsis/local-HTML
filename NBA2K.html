        <h3>AI in NBA2K Games over the years</h3>
        <p>
           Similar to FIFA, early NBA 2K games had relatively basic AI, with limited player intelligence and strategic depth. Throughout the 2000s, the NBA 2K series evolved its AI to deliver more realistic basketball simulations. Developers focused on player movement, offensive and defensive strategies, and adapting to player preferences. In 2010 NBA 2K introduced a more sophisticated player attribute system, allowing AI-controlled players to exhibit unique skills and playing styles. Also in the same year, developers emphasized realism in player animations, crowd reactions, and overall game presentation.

            <ul>
                <li><h5>Team tactics:</h5><p>NBA 2K's AI opponents simulate real basketball team dynamics. This involves running plays, setting screens, and executing offensive and defensive strategies similar to those seen in professional basketball.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><h5>Player collaboration:</h5><p>AI-controlled teams work together cohesively, passing the ball, setting up plays, and reacting to the opposing team's movements.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Adaptive AI:


            <ul>
                <li><h5>Response to player actions:</h5><p>Similar to FIFA, NBA 2K's AI adapts to the player's actions. If a player consistently exploits certain moves or plays, the AI adjusts its defensive and offensive strategies to counteract those actions. </p></li>
                <li><h5>Difficulty scaling:</h5><p>The game offers varying difficulty levels, and the AI opponents' skill levels change accordingly. This ensures that players are consistently challenged as they progress.</p></li>
            </ul>

        <li>Player signature styles:

            <ul>
                <li><h5>Individual player behaviors:</h5> <p>AI-controlled players in NBA 2K exhibit styles inspired by real NBA athletes. Each player's unique skills, playing style, and signature moves are accurately represented in the game, contributing to a more authentic experience.</p>

        <li>Learning and improvement:
            <ul>
                <li><h5>Continuous development:</h5><p>Game developers may implement updates and patches to improve AI behavior based on player feedback and evolving real-world basketball strategies. This ongoing development helps maintain a high level of realism and engagement.</p>
