    <h3>Bugs</h3>
    <p>Bots may try to walk/shoot through unmovable objects such as walls.</p>
    <p>Whenever a player/bot cloaks/decloaks or disguises/undisguises, the bots will 'see' players who are behind them and turn around, even if out of the bot's field of view. Note that this isn't due to any sounds made by the player (footsteps, miscellaneous weapon noises, etc.).</p>
    <p>Though rarely, bots may stand inside one another during usage of an Engineer's Teleporter and get stuck (can't move).</p>
    <p>When bots use voice commands (such as "Spy!" and "Move Up!"), text versions of the voice commands do not display.</p>
    <p>A Medic bot who is healing a player will not avoid enemy fire or collect health pickups, even if he is at critically low health.</p>
    <p>Bots are able to move while taunting, making the Holiday Punch ineffective.</p>
    <p>Recently attacked Medic bots will often fail to use their Syringe Gun to deal with enemies at non-melee range, instead switching to their Bonesaw, or even to their Medi Gun on extremely rare occasions.</p>
    <p>Medic bots will fail to lead their aim or to compensate for gravity while firing the Syringe Gun. This may be due to the Syringe Gun not being properly identified as a non-hitscan weapon in the bot AI code.</p>
    <p>Spy bots are able to see and follow cloaked Spies (AI or player) should one give himself away, regardless of the difficulty level.</p>
    <p>Even if a Spy is disguised as a class of his team (player only, as bots will never do this), enemies will still point him out as a Spy should he bump into an enemy.</p>
